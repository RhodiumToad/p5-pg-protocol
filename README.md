PostgreSQL Wire Protocol Modules (Experimental!)
================================================

**WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL CODE**

Code to handle the PostgreSQL server protocol (version 3) in pure
perl. This isn't really intended to be useful as such, it exists
primarily to play with possible protocol changes, buffering
strategies, and so on.
